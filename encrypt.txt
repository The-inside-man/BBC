KAISESLAUTERN, Germany — The new trial begins Monday of a Spangdahlem airman whose conviction and prison sentence for negligent homicide were tossed out on a technicality on appeal.
Airman Basic Alan J. Lindgren faces a new round of charges for his alleged role in the deaths of two fellow airmen in a horrific, high-speed car crash on Germany’s autobahn in July 2010.
Killed were Amanda Jotham, 19, and Brandon McDonald, 20, airmen first class who were passengers in Lindgren’s car. Lindgren lost control of his BMW M-3 on the A-60 between Spangdahlem Air Base and Bitburg while driving at an estimated 149 mph, according to evidence presented at his first trial.
